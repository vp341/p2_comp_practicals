In this task, first different levels of damping were investigated. q=1 was
light, q=10 was overdamped and q=5 is close to critical damping.

For the second part, the driving force was varied and the period observed.
There is a peak at F = 1.2. As advised, the period was observed in the angular
velocity rather than the displacement as wrap around errors caused problems.
