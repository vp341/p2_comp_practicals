I managed to find the period vs intial angle relationship and the energy loss.
I found the period by counting the number of sign changes of the angle over
the total time, the period is then 2*totalTime/#changes. Thus the period can
be found in this way. Because the entire sample is 1000 seconds long, any
0-based errors will be very small. The period found for theta_0 = pi/2 is
7.3800s.
