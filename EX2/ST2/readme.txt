In this task, omega vs theta relations were found for various different
initial conditions, dampings and driving forces.

Figure 1 shows a simple no damping system, this plots a circle as would be
expect.


Figure 2 shows a lightly damped system, the fluctuations in both theta and
omega can be seen to decrease to zero.

Figure 3 shows an overdamped system. Omega quickly increases, returning the
particle back to the origin.

Figure 4 shows a driven system with no damping. The regular nature of the
driving force can be seen. As the particle starts at theta = 0 there is no
transient.

Figure 5 shows a similar system which is now under damped. The system can be
seen to eventually tend to a stable oscillation as the chaotic transient
decays.

Figure 6 shows a more heavily damped system, here theta continually increases
with a regular pattern.

Figure 7 shows a system with a weaker driving force. Here theta still
increases, however, each oscillation is more complicated.
